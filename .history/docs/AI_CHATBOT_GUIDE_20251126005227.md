# AI Chatbot Terminal Guide

## Overview
Your portfolio terminal now includes an AI-powered chatbot that acts as your digital twin! It uses the GROQ API and your vertex database to answer questions about you.

## How to Use

### 1. Open the Terminal
- Click on the Terminal app in your portfolio
- You'll see the standard terminal interface

### 2. Enter Chat Mode
Type one of these commands:
```bash
chat
```
or
```bash
ai
```

You'll see:
```
🤖 Entering chat mode with Diwan's Digital Twin...
Ask me anything! Type 'exit' to return to terminal.
```

### 3. Ask Questions
Once in chat mode, just type naturally:
- "What projects have you worked on?"
- "Tell me about your experience"
- "What technologies do you know?"
- "What's your background?"

The AI will respond as you, pulling from your digital twin knowledge base.

### 4. Exit Chat Mode
When you're done chatting, type:
```bash
exit
```
or
```bash
quit
```

## Troubleshooting

### If AI doesn't respond:
1. Check that your `.env.local` has the correct `GROQ_API_KEY`
2. Verify your digital twin MCP server is running
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure the `/api/chat` route is working

### Common Issues:
- **"Unable to reach AI"** - Network issue or API endpoint down
- **Slow responses** - Normal, AI takes time to process
- **Empty responses** - Check your digital twin database has content

## Next Steps
- Test different questions to train your responses
- Add more personality to your digital twin knowledge base
- Customize the AI's tone and style in the MCP server
